    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: December 7, 2025</div>

    <p><strong>A R K URBANS INFRAA</strong>is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to <a href="http://www.arkurbansinfraa.com">www.arkurbansinfraa.com</a> (the "Site") and clients who engage our services. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> name, postal address, email address, phone number when you enquire or register interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Project and transaction data:</strong> details of projects you view, requests for quotations, contract and payment information where applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> IP address, browser type, pages visited, referral URL, device and technical data collected automatically via cookies and logging tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing preferences:</strong> whether you opt-in to receive promotional emails or communications from us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we collect information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Directly from you — e.g., when you fill forms, send emails, call or meet us.</li>
      <li>Automatically — via cookies and analytics tools when you use the Site.</li>
      <li>From third-party sources — for example, if you contact us through a third-party listing or partner site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Purpose of processing</h2>
    <p>We use personal information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respond to enquiries and provide services (project proposals, site visits, quotations).</li>
      <li>Manage contracts, invoicing and payments.</li>
      <li>Improve and personalise our website, services and communications.</li>
      <li>Send administrative notices, updates and marketing if you have consented.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal or regulatory obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies and tracking</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to operate the Site and improve user experience. Cookies may be essential (site functionality) or non-essential (analytics, marketing). You can control cookies in your browser settings; blocking some cookies may affect Site functionality.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers and partners who assist in delivering our services (e.g., architects, consultants, payment processors).</li>
      <li>Legal or regulatory authorities if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
      <li>Affiliated companies for business administration and group services, if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data from unauthorised access, loss or disclosure. However, no internet transmission is completely secure — if you have sensitive information, contact us directly rather than transmit it through unsecured channels.</p>

    <h2>7. Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described (service delivery, legal compliance, dispute resolution). If you wish to request deletion, see <strong>Your rights</strong> below.</p>

    <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, port, restrict or erase your personal data, and to object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before responding.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-party links</h2>
    <p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices — please review those sites' policies separately.</p>

    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed at children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
