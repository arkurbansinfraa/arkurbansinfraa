    </ul>

    <h2>2. Quotations and Acceptance</h2>

    <h2>3. Scope of Services</h2>
    <p>We will provide Services as set out in the quotation/contract. Any changes requested by the Client that affect scope, cost or schedule must be agreed in writing (change order) and may attract additional fees.</p>

    <h2>4. Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments are due as specified in the quotation/contract (e.g., advance deposit, progress payments, final payment).</li>
      <li>Late payments may attract interest and/or suspension of Services until payment is received.</li>
      <li>All prices are exclusive of applicable taxes unless stated otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Client obligations</h2>
    <p>The Client must provide accurate information, approvals, access to sites, timely decisions and any required permissions or documents. Delays caused by the Client may affect timeframes and costs.</p>

    <h2>6. Warranties &amp; Liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We warrant that Services will be provided with reasonable skill and care in accordance with industry standards.</li>
      <li>Except where prohibited by law, our liability for any claim arising under or in connection with the Services (contract, tort or otherwise) shall be limited to the total amount paid by the Client for the relevant Services.</li>
      <li>We are not liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential loss, including loss of profit, except as required by applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h2>10. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Neither party is liable for delays or failures resulting from events beyond reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, strikes, acts of government). Affected performance will be suspended for the duration of the event.</p>
